Generated by Claude with prompts only, no manual code editing.

## Overview

A web-based **string art generator** that transforms any image into stunning thread-based artwork. Built with **HTML5 Canvas** for smooth rendering and real-time visualization of the generation process.

## Features

### 🎨 Art Generation

- **Custom Images**: Upload your own photos to create unique string art.
- **Greedy Algorithm**: Iteratively selects optimal string paths for best results.
- **Grayscale Conversion**: Automatic luminance-based image processing.
- **Circular Frame**: Classic string art aesthetic with pegs around a circle.

### ⚙️ Adjustable Parameters

- **Number of Pegs**: Configure from **180 to 360** pegs around the circle.
- **Line Opacity**: Control string darkness from **3% to 30%**.
- **Threshold**: Fine-tune sensitivity for detail vs. simplicity.
- **Max Lines**: Set limits from **1,000 to 10,000** strings.

### 🎮 Interactive Controls

- **Real-time Preview**: Watch the artwork build string by string.
- **Progress Tracking**: Live statistics for strings, iterations, and time.
- **Stop Anytime**: Pause generation and keep current progress.
- **One-click Download**: Export your creation as a PNG image.

### 🖱️ User Experience

- **Drag & Drop**: Simply drop images onto the upload zone.
- **Side-by-side View**: Compare source image with generated art.
- **Responsive UI**: Clean, dark-themed interface with intuitive controls.
- **Smart Filenames**: Downloads include original filename and timestamp.

## 🛠 Technical Highlights

- **Canvas API** for high-performance 2D rendering.
- **Bresenham's Algorithm** for precise line pixel calculation.
- **Pre-computed Line Cache** dramatically improves generation speed.
- **Typed Arrays** (Float32Array, Uint8Array, Uint32Array) for memory efficiency.
- **Async/Await Pattern** keeps UI responsive during generation.
- **Set-based Tracking** with numeric keys for O(1) connection lookup.

## 🎯 Algorithm

The generator uses a **greedy optimization** approach:

1. Place N pegs evenly around a circle
2. Start with a white canvas
3. For each peg, find the connection that reduces the most "error"
4. Draw that string (semi-transparent black line)
5. Repeat until convergence or limits reached

Each string darkens pixels along its path. By always choosing the line that most needs darkening, the image progressively emerges through overlapping threads.

## 🎓 Use Cases

- **Physical Recreation**: Generate patterns to build real string art.
- **Portrait Art**: Transform photos into unique thread-based portraits.
- **Educational Tool**: Visualize optimization algorithms in action.
- **Creative Projects**: Generate unique artwork for prints or gifts.

## 🌐 Browser Support

- Compatible with modern desktop browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).
- **Mobile devices supported** but desktop recommended for best experience.
