# String Art Generator

Live Demo: [https://rencheng0525.github.io/StringArt/](https://rencheng0525.github.io/StringArt/)

Generated by Claude with prompts only, no manual code editing.

## Overview

A web-based **string art generator** that transforms any image into stunning thread-based artwork. Built with **HTML5 Canvas** for smooth rendering and real-time visualization of the generation process.

**Key Feature**: Generates a **continuous path** that can be directly used for physical string art recreation — wind one thread from start to finish without cutting!

## Features

### 🎨 Art Generation

- **Custom Images**: Upload your own photos to create unique string art.
- **Continuous Path Algorithm**: Generates an unbroken winding sequence for physical recreation.
- **Grayscale Conversion**: Automatic luminance-based image processing.
- **Circular Frame**: Classic string art aesthetic with pegs around a circle.

### ⚙️ Adjustable Parameters

- **Number of Pegs**: Configure from **180 to 360** pegs around the circle.
- **Line Opacity**: Control string darkness from **3% to 30%**.
- **Threshold**: Fine-tune sensitivity for detail vs. simplicity.
- **Max Lines**: Set limits from **1,000 to 10,000** strings.

### 🎮 Interactive Controls

- **Real-time Preview**: Watch the artwork build string by string.
- **Progress Tracking**: Live statistics for strings and elapsed time.
- **Stop Anytime**: Pause generation and keep current progress.
- **One-click Download**: Export your creation as a PNG image.

### 🧵 Path Export (for Physical Recreation)

- **Continuous Path**: The generated sequence is a true unbroken path — no jumping between pegs!
- **Multiple Formats**:
  - **Sequence**: `0 → 180 → 45 → 230 → 12 → ...` (best for winding)
  - **Steps**: Numbered list showing each connection
  - **CSV**: Spreadsheet-compatible format
  - **JSON**: Structured data with metadata
- **Copy to Clipboard**: Instantly copy path data.
- **Download Path**: Save as `.txt`, `.csv`, or `.json` file.
- **Peg Numbering**: Starts from **0** at top (12 o'clock), clockwise.

### 🖱️ User Experience

- **Drag & Drop**: Simply drop images onto the upload zone.
- **Side-by-side View**: Compare source image with generated art.
- **Responsive UI**: Clean, dark-themed interface with intuitive controls.
- **Smart Filenames**: Downloads include original filename and timestamp.

## 🛠 Technical Highlights

- **Canvas API** for high-performance 2D rendering.
- **Bresenham's Algorithm** for precise line pixel calculation.
- **Pre-computed Line Cache** dramatically improves generation speed.
- **Typed Arrays** (Float32Array, Uint8Array, Uint32Array) for memory efficiency.
- **Async/Await Pattern** keeps UI responsive during generation.

## 🎯 Algorithm

The generator uses a **continuous path greedy algorithm**:

1. Place N pegs evenly around a circle (peg 0 at 12 o'clock)
2. Start at peg 0 with a white canvas
3. From the **current peg**, find the best unvisited connection that reduces the most "error"
4. Draw that string and **move to the new peg**
5. Repeat until no good connections remain or limits reached

This ensures the output is a **single continuous path** like:
```
0 → 180 → 45 → 230 → 12 → 195 → 67 → ...
```

Each arrow represents winding the thread from one peg to the next — exactly how you would create it physically!

## 🎓 Use Cases

- **Physical Recreation**: Export the continuous path to build real string art projects.
- **Portrait Art**: Transform photos into unique thread-based portraits.
- **Educational Tool**: Visualize greedy optimization algorithms in action.
- **Creative Projects**: Generate unique artwork for prints or gifts.

## 🌐 Browser Support

- Compatible with modern desktop browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).
- **Mobile devices supported** but desktop recommended for best experience.
